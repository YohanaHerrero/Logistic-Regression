Using logistic regression, I create a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.

I use a telecommunications dataset (ChurnData.csv) for predicting customer churn. Each row represents one customer. I predict which customers will stay with the company, since it is easier to keep costumers than to attract new ones. The dataset includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
